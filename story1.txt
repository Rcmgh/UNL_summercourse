Once there was a young woman named Vidya who lived in a village. She wanted to travel and explore the world, but she couldn't speak English. So, she joined an English course in her village. Vidya learned grammar, vocabulary, and how to pronounce words. She practised talking with her classmates and understood simple conversations. Vidya felt more confident and decided to travel alone to an English-speaking country. She visited big cities, talked to local people, and learned about different cultures. Vidya realized that learning English opened doors to new experiences and helped her connect with people from all over the world. Her journey showed that with determination and learning, anything is possible.
